# Database Connection Fix for Vercel Deployment

## Issue Description
The Django application was failing on Vercel with the error:
```
OperationalError: connection to server at "localhost" (127.0.0.1), port 5432 failed: Connection refused
```

This was happening because:
1. The database configuration was falling back to localhost instead of using Neon PostgreSQL
2. The tenant middleware was trying to query the database before the connection was properly configured
3. Environment variables were not being set correctly in the Vercel environment

## Fixed Files

### 1. `backend/dashboard/settings.py`
- **Changes**: Improved database configuration with production defaults
- **Key Changes**:
  - Added production database credentials as defaults instead of localhost
  - Enhanced error handling and logging for database configuration
  - Better fallback mechanism with SQLite for debugging

### 2. `backend/vercel.json`
- **Changes**: Added database environment variables
- **Key Changes**:
  - Added `DATABASE_URL` as a complete PostgreSQL connection string
  - Added individual database environment variables (`DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, etc.)
  - Set `DEBUG=False` for production

### 3. `backend/excel_data/middleware/tenant_middleware.py`
- **Changes**: Added database error handling
- **Key Changes**:
  - Wrapped all database queries in try-catch blocks
  - Added specific handling for `OperationalError` (database connection issues)
  - Allow requests to continue without tenant when database is unavailable
  - Added root endpoint and health check endpoints to public endpoints list

### 4. `backend/dashboard/urls.py`
- **Changes**: Added root endpoint to prevent 404 errors
- **Key Changes**:
  - Created a simple root endpoint that returns API information
  - Added proper URL routing for the root path `/`

### 5. `backend/health_check.py`
- **Changes**: Enhanced database health check endpoint
- **Key Changes**:
  - Added detailed database configuration information
  - Added environment variable diagnostics
  - Better error reporting for debugging

## Database Configuration Details

### Neon PostgreSQL Credentials
```
Host: ep-lingering-block-a1olkbv3-pooler.ap-southeast-1.aws.neon.tech
Database: neondb
User: neondb_owner
Password: npg_kiW2lJnVcsu8
Port: 5432
SSL Mode: require
```

### Environment Variables Set in Vercel
```json
{
  "DATABASE_URL": "postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_kiW2lJnVcsu8@ep-lingering-block-a1olkbv3-pooler.ap-southeast-1.aws.neon.tech:5432/neondb?sslmode=require",
  "DB_NAME": "neondb",
  "DB_USER": "neondb_owner",
  "DB_PASSWORD": "npg_kiW2lJnVcsu8",
  "DB_HOST": "ep-lingering-block-a1olkbv3-pooler.ap-southeast-1.aws.neon.tech",
  "DB_PORT": "5432",
  "DEBUG": "False",
  "DJANGO_USE_LIGHTWEIGHT": "true"
}
```

## Testing Endpoints

### Local Testing Results
✅ Database connection: Working  
✅ Health check endpoint: Working  
✅ Database health check: Working  
✅ Root endpoint: Working  

### Available Endpoints
- `/` - Root API information endpoint
- `/health/` - Basic health check
- `/health/db/` - Database connection health check
- `/admin/` - Django admin
- `/api/` - Main HRMS API endpoints

## Expected Resolution
With these changes:
1. The database connection should work properly in Vercel using Neon PostgreSQL
2. The tenant middleware will handle database connection errors gracefully
3. Health check endpoints are available for debugging
4. The root endpoint won't cause tenant resolution errors
5. Environment variables are properly configured in the Vercel environment

## Next Steps
1. Deploy the updated code to Vercel
2. Test the health check endpoints: `/health/` and `/health/db/`
3. Verify that the root endpoint `/` works without errors
4. Monitor the application logs for any remaining issues

## Troubleshooting
If issues persist:
1. Check `/health/db/` endpoint to verify database configuration
2. Check Vercel function logs for any remaining errors
3. Verify that environment variables are set correctly in Vercel dashboard
4. Test individual endpoints to isolate any remaining issues

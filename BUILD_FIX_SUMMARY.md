# Build Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed ✅
**Vercel Build Error**: 
```
sh: line 1: cd: frontend: No such file or directory
Error: Command "cd frontend && npm install && cd ../backend && pip install -r requirements.txt" exited with 1
```

## Root Cause
Root-level `vercel.json` was trying to build both frontend and backend as a monorepo with:
```json
{
  "installCommand": "cd frontend && npm install && cd ../backend && pip install -r requirements.txt"
}
```

## Solution Applied
1. **Deleted root `vercel.json`** ✅
2. **Previously fixed `frontend/index.html`** ✅ (changed `/src/main.tsx` to `./src/main.tsx`)
3. **Backend has individual `backend/vercel.json`** ✅
4. **Frontend uses auto-detection** ✅

## Next Steps
Deploy as **two separate Vercel projects**:
1. **Backend Project**: Root directory = `backend`
2. **Frontend Project**: Root directory = `frontend`

Both projects will deploy independently and work together via API calls.

## Files Changed
- ❌ Deleted: `vercel.json` (root level)
- ✅ Fixed: `frontend/index.html` (script import path)
- ✅ Exists: `backend/vercel.json` (backend-specific config)

The build should now succeed for both projects when deployed separately.
